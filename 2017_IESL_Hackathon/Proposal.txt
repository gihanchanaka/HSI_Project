What is Hyper Spectral Imagery?

Hyperspectral imaging, like other spectral imaging, collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum.
Whereas the human eye sees color of visible light in mostly three bands (red, green, and blue), spectral imaging divides the spectrum into many more bands. This technique of dividing images into bands can be extended beyond the visible. In hyperspectral imaging, the recorded spectra have fine wavelength resolution and cover a wide range of wavelengths.
Hyperspectral sensors and processing systems are used for applications in astronomy, agriculture, biomedical imaging, geosciences, physics, and surveillance.
Certain objects leave unique 'fingerprints' in the electromagnetic spectrum. Known as spectral signatures, these 'fingerprints' enable identification of the materials that make up a scanned object.
