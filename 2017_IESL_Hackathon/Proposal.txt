What is "Expert Miner"?
Expert Miner is a software program which uses Hyper Spectral Image analysis to pinpoint the natural earth reources in Sri Lanka.

Why is "Expert Miner" useful?
Since mining is a capital intensive process developing countries such as SriLanka find it hard to reach local investors. The reason being, the traditional methods used for exploration such as geological method has a low success rate, and when it fails, most of the costs are identified as losses. Expert miner assists in increasing the success rate and gives a significant assurance regarding the existance of a mineral.
