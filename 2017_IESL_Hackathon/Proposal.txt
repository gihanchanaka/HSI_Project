What is Hyper Spectral Imagery?
@Hasrhana fill this

What is "Expert Miner"?
Expert Miner is a software program which uses Hyper Spectral Image analysis to pinpoint the natural earth reources in Sri Lanka.

Why is "Expert Miner" useful?
Since mining is a capital intensive process developing countries such as SriLanka find it hard to reach local investors. The reason being, the traditional methods used for exploration such as geological method has a low success rate, and when it fails, most of the costs are identified as losses. Expert miner assists in increasing the success rate and gives a significant assurance regarding the existance of a mineral.



Target users?
The mineral mining companies
Oil mining companies
Government

Similar products and competition?
There are no simillar product at the moment since HSI is a relatively new technique.
The alternatives are the traditional geological and geochemical processes which are risky and costly(Since expedtition may fail). Expert miner reduces the risk involved in expedition.

Technologies and resources?
Hyper spectral image data of Sri Lanka from Nasa Sattelites (avaliable for free)
Hyper spectral spectrums of minerals from universities (avaliable for free)
Numerical computing packages- MATLAB, Python (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib)
University of Peradeniya servers (http://www.tesla.ce.pdn.ac.lk/)

Revenue Model?
Selling the software to mining corporations.
Consultation services for mining corporations.
